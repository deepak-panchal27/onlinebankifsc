<p>The State Bank of India started its journey as Bank of Calcutta on 2nd June 1806. Bank of Calcutta was later renamed as Bank of Bengal and it was part of one of three presidency Banks in India in those times. The other two presidency banks were the Bank of Bombay and Bank of Madras which were established on 15th April 1840 and 1st July 1843, respectively. These three banks subsequently were amalgamated into one and were called Imperial Bank of India.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank of India had the majority stake in the Imperial Bank of India. This Imperial Bank of India later become the State Bank of India which we know as of today on 1st July 1955. The Government of India acquired the RBI’s stake in SBI in 2008 to avoid any conflict of interest. </p>
